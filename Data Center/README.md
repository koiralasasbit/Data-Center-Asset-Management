We have backend app with RESTful API, which allows us to update our database with rest functionality. The instructions to install are given inside respective folders.
1. Functional Frontend
2. Functional Backend \
And another front end app that allows to make modifications in the database straight from the userend.
We initially planned to combine these two and make a fully functional app with full stack development possibilities, but due to some time constrains and involvement in other projects, we had to wrap up with the submission.

You can run respective project with the help of the Readme.docs file inside.
